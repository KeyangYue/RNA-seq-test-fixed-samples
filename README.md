The reads are quality checked using fastqc0.12.1 and poly-A tails were trimmed using fastP. 
The zUMIs pipline was applied to the trimmed reads for filtering and demultiplexing. The filtered data were mapped onto gencode GRCh38 primary genome assembly with STAR 2.7.3.a.
Reads/UMIs were counted using Rsubread 1.32.4.
